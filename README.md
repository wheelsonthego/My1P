## Development

See the [docs](http://alphadocs.init.ai/reference/cli.html) for details on setting up the CLI.

### Installation

#### Node.js version

To [run your scripts locally](link/to/docs), you should make sure to use Node.js version 4.3.2.

We recommend using [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) to easily manage Node.js versions on your machine. This project is pre-provisioned with an `.nvmrc` file so you may simply run:

```bash
$ nvm use
```

#### Install dependencies

```bash
$ npm i
```
